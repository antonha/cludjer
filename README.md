# Cludjer

Simple window manager thingy built on top of 
https://github.com/sdegutis/zephyros using Clojure. 

Sets up a few bindings for nudging windows in different directions on the 
screen. Use main.clj as the script for Zephyros. Remember to 
**use TCP sockets**, as the Clojure API can not use unix sockets See 
https://github.com/sdegutis/zephyros/blob/master/Docs/Clojure.md
for setup instructions.
